### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘“ My name is Brady Emerson, I am a recent graduate of Grand Valley State University. I obtained a Bachelor's of Business Adminstration in Operations Management and Applied Statistics. I am passionate about Business Intelligence, Econometrics, Game Theory, and Data Analytics in general! I plan on pursuing my Master's in Operations Research, with dreams of achieving a Doctoral Degree.

ðŸ’» I comfortable working with MS Excel, Tableau, and SAS. I do most of my work in SAS Studio, however I do have experience working with Enterprise Guide, 9.4/Base, and JMP. I am working on getting my SAS Programming Certification.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a developing a Sports Analytics program using SAS Macro Language. I have seperate progream to look at each of the Big 4 Leagues (NBA, MLB, NFL, & NHL). I an using this project to improve my skills and understanding of the SAS Macro Language.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning about the Python Language and how to add it to my current data analysis workflow. I also plan on adding R to my statistical analysis toolbox.

ðŸ“š I enjoy reading books on Personal Development, Economics, and Non-Fiction. Currently my favorite reads has been _Atomic Habits_ by James CLear, _Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Predicting_ by Dan Gardner & Philip E. Tetlock, and _Moneyball_ by Michael Lewis

â˜• Outside of school and data analytics I am passionate about coffee and whiskey. When I get the chance to travel I enjoy looking for local coffee shops and distilleries in the cities I visit. I enjoy watching sports, which might have been given away from above, but love golfing any chance I get when the weather is nice.

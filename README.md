### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘“ My name is Brady Emerson, I am a graduate of Grand Valley State University where I obtained my Bachelor's of Business Adminstration in Operations Management and Applied Statistics. I am passionate about Business Intelligence, Econometrics, Game Theory, and Data Analytics in general! 

ðŸ’» I comfortable working with MS Excel, Tableau, and SAS. I do most of my work in SAS Studio, however I do have experience working with Enterprise Guide, 9.4/Base, and JMP.

ðŸ“š I enjoy reading books on Personal Development, Economics, and Non-Fiction. Currently my favorite reads has been _Atomic Habits_ by James CLear, _Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Predicting_ by Dan Gardner & Philip E. Tetlock, and _Moneyball_ by Michael Lewis

â˜• Outside of school and data analytics I am passionate about coffee and whiskey. When I get the chance to travel I enjoy looking for local coffee shops and distilleries in the cities I visit. I enjoy watching sports, which might have been given away from above, but enjoy golfing any chance I get when the weather is nice.
